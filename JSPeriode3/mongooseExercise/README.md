1. Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.
 - NoSQL uses documents with JSON format, so it is easy to convert to javascript.
 - NoSQL dosnt use relations.
 - MongoDB is not schema/structure build database. 
 
2. Explain Pros & Cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB as your data store, compared to a traditional Relational SQL Database like MySQL.
 - In NoSQL databases you might have to chance the same value different places where with relational databases to just chance it one place
   - Example: Relationa datebase 2 persons have a ralation to one address, where in NoSQL Persons can have the same address but its  in 2 different places.
   
3. Explain how databases like MongoDB and redis would be classified in the NoSQL world
 - MongoDB and redis stores as documents.
   - Example: It is a document written in json so it is easy to convert to javascript.
   
4. Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB
 - Makes it eaiser to use the database.
   - Schemas to build database and have a query to get data.
 - It is similar to ORM.
   - we get types.
 - cant forget to hash a password because of the hook.

5. Explain, and demonstrate, using relevant examples, the strategy for querying MongoDB (all CRUD operations)
 -
 
6. Explain about indexes in MongoDB, how to create them, and demonstrate how you have used them.
 -
 
7. Explain, using your own code examples, how you have used some of MongoDB's "special" indexes like TTL and 2dsphere
 -
 
8. Demonstrate, using a REST-API you have designed, how to perform all CRUD operations on a MongoDB
 -
 
9. Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB
 -
 
10. Explain the benefits from using Mongoose, and provide an example involving all CRUD operations
 -
 
11. Explain the benefits from using Mongoose, and demonstrate, using your own code, an example involving all CRUD operations
 -
 
12. Explain how redis "fits" into the NoSQL world, and provide an example of how you have used it.
 -
 
13. Explain, using a relevant example, a full MEAN application (the A, can be an ionic application) including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)
