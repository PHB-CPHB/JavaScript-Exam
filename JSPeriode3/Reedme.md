- Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top on of a schema-less database like MongoDB
- Explain the benefits from using Mongoose, and provide an example involving all CRUD operations
- Explain the benefits from using Mongoose, and demonstrate, using your own code, an example involving all CRUD operations
- Explain, using a relevant example, a full MEAN application (the A, can be an ionic application) including relevant test cases to test the REST-API (not on the production database)
