# JSPeriode5 - React
### Note: This description is too big for a single exam-question. It will be divided up into separate questions for the exam

## Describe the term Single Page Application (SPA) and why it’s relevant for modern web-applications
## Describe fundamental differences between the SPA-framework/libraries AngularJS and React
## Describe the overall principles used in React to create a SPA

## Explain, using an example, the fundamental building blocks in React Applications like: 
### JSX
### Rendering Elements
### Components and Props
### State and LifeCycle
### Handling Events
### List and Keys
### Working with Forms
### Lifting State Up

## Describe tools like Babel, WebPack and create-react-app and how the fit in to the React-world

## Explain, using examples, about Class Components, versus pure JavaScript functions in React, and when to use them.

## Explain the purpose of Client Side Routing in a SPA
 - So we dont have to reload to side all the time, we just updata the view.
## Explain, using an example of your own, the basic “building blocks” in react-router
## Explain what is required to use react-router with a create-react-app project build from scratch

## Explain, using examples, how JavaScript array methods, like filter, map and (reduce) are used to generate dynamic HTML structures (tables, ul's etc.), and explain about React Keys.

## Props vs State
 - Props you cant change.
 - Props are set by the parent and is fixed throughout the lifetime of the component.
 - State is something you can store for later use.
 - State can be changed by setState, which will update the page.
