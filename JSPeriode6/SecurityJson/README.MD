# Period-6 Security and how to secure Node/Express/REST-Backends 
 
## Explain basic security terms like authentication, authorization, confidentiality, integrity, SSL/TLS and provide examples of how you have used them.
## Explain, at a fundamental level, the technologies involved, and the steps required, to setup a SSL connection between a browser and a server, and how to use SSL in a secure way.
## How can we "prevent" third party code used, by either our Java or NodeJS applications, from injecting dangerous code into our code base?
## Explain about Node tools like Helmet and nsp (the Node Security Project). What do they do, and how have you used them.
## Explain basic security threads like: Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), SQL Injection and whether something similar to SQL injection is possible with NoSQL databases like MongoDB, and DOS-attacks. Explain/demonstrate ways to cope with these problems, preferably via your suggestion for a seed.
## Explain and demonstrate ways to protect user passwords on our backend, and why this is necessary.
## Explain about password hashing, salts and the difference between Bcrypt and older (not suited) algorithms like sha1, md5 etc.
## Explain about JSON Web Tokens (jwt) and why they are extremely suited for a REST-based API
## Explain and demonstrate a basic NodeJS/React application and how it handles authentication, authorization, prevents against Cross Site Scripting and other basic web-threats.
